# Right Mind. Wrong Time.

You've probably heard of Nikola Tesla. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/85da6fe5-0f49-490d-b135-42bfef54d204.jpg)

You've seen his biopic (or maybe not). 

Or maybe you've only known him from Elon Musk's next Tesla 3 which he will be announcing anytime soon. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7b172486-06fe-4cac-9f34-768307a82062.jpg)

Or maybe you\`re just like me. Only to know Nikola Tesla, who made amazing discoveries alternating-current electrical system that's widely used today and discovered the rotating magnetic field (the basis of most AC machinery) from the comical site [The Oatmeal][0] - Comics by Matthew Inman. 

And that's fine. And that's what this site is all about. 

We\`re here on a journey to explore Nikola Tesla, who was suppose to bring FREE electricity to the world, ended up in a tiny shack owning close to nothing at his death bed. 

Was he a man born with the right mind? Or was he way out of his league? Was his genius seen as some sort of sorcery which led to his outcast? 

Ultimately, we're here to discuss if Tesla at this day and age will led into a different ending or the society would simply brand him as another lunatic? Would time even made a difference? Even with the right mind? (Vice versa) 

# Right Here. Wrong Again.
