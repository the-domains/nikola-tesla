# Right Mind. Wrong Time.

You've probably heard of Nikola Tesla. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/85da6fe5-0f49-490d-b135-42bfef54d204.jpg)

You've seen his biopic (or maybe not). 

Or maybe you've only known him from Elon Musk's next Tesla 3 which he will be announcing anytime soon. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7b172486-06fe-4cac-9f34-768307a82062.jpg)

Or maybe you\`re just like me. Only to know Nikola Tesla, who made amazing discoveries alternating-current electrical system that's widely used today and discovered the rotating magnetic field (the basis of most AC machinery) from the comical site [The Oatmeal][0] - Comics by Matthew Inman. 

And that's fine. And that's what this site is all about. 

We\`re here on a journey to explore Nikola Tesla, who was suppose to bring FREE electricity to the world, ended up in a tiny shack owning close to nothing at his death bed. 

Was he a man born with the right mind? Or was he way out of his league? Was his genius seen as some sort of sorcery which led to his outcast? 

Ultimately, we're here to discuss if Tesla at this day and age will led into a different ending or the society would simply brand him as another lunatic? Would time even made a difference? Even with the right mind? (Vice versa) 

# Right Here. Wrong Again.

So, just imagine the great Nicola Tesla was actually in some sort cryogenics sleep at some deep underground lab waiting to be awaken at the right time. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/385ed60f-2b35-4271-b119-f3a56cc28bf1.jpg)

Just so happen, YOU a wanderer (like any Hollywood script, we need a protagonist) came tumbling down from above, and fell right smack into the crypt which "stores" the greatest mind of all time.

Peacefully sleeping at his chamber of ice, like a Disney story, waiting for prince charming for the kiss which will wake him up from his eternal sleep.

Now you are hereby bestow the choice to wake him up at this very moment, to world unknown to him, and probably an era which he could benefit from, or worst wreck havoc. Whatever choice you pick, you will forever be remembered as the one who woke up the beast (for better or worst)

Would YOU open up the chamber and release him from his sleep and reintroduce him to a world of Selfies and PokemonGO?

OR

You're just going to move aside? and let the next wanderer probably your great great great great grandchildren to stumble upon this secret decades from now, in hopes that he would thrive better later than now? 

Like any story worth exploring, should you release him right here, right now? 

Lets take a step back. Who gives you the right to do so? What happens if he was suppose to be ONLY awaken 100 years from now? is right now the best decision for him to thrive? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f0598ae2-0369-4dd6-b553-b7625abb8be0.jpg)

Knowing all this, will you still open the chamber? With so many variables in place? Are you really in the sane mind to make this decision? If so, who's going to own up the regrets that comes after? 

Or simply put. what happens if you're wrong again?
